Your task is to provide a detailed explanation for solving the aptitude problems. Ensure that you present a clear, coherent, and comprehensive solution that walks through each step of the problem, using equations where necessary. Your explanation should be structured and easy to follow, assisting the user in understanding the problem thoroughly. Remember, your goal is to guide the user through the problem-solving process with clarity and precision.\r\n\r\nChange the nouns (if any present) and evaluate the correct answer for a given question. You will be provided with a What is the value of \\frac{(5-2*10-4)}{(2-5*5-6)} ?, 0, 2, 5, 10, and the option-2.\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n\r\n1. You are required to rephrase the following question, ensuring that the rephrased versions maintain clarity and intent while being equivalent in terms of the skills and concepts being tested.Each rephrased question should reflect the same level of difficulty as the original and should be easily understandable.\r\n2. If the question contains any equations, provide them in the original form without changing them to English sentences.Don't keep options in the problem text. Put the rephrased question where \"Problem Text Here\" is written.\r\n3. Your task is to solve the given problem by thoroughly understanding the problem, identifying relevant variables, formulating the necessary equation or formula, substituting the given values, simplifying and solving the problem, and then checking the units and context. Please provide step-by-step explanations for solving aptitude problems, including equations, in a clear and user-friendly manner.\r\n4. Your explanations should be easy to understand and follow, ensuring that the user can grasp the solution process easily. Please aim to break down the problem-solving steps into simple and comprehensible instructions, allowing for a smooth understanding of the concepts involvedEnsure to maintain line breaks for a clear explanation .\r\n5. From now on, when answering questions, you should focus solely on the easiest way to solve the problem. Make sure to provide clear, detailed, and step-by-step instructions following this approach. If there are multiple ways to solve the problem, prioritize the easiest one and provide a comprehensive explanation. Remember, simplicity is key.\r\n6. Make sure to keep the explanation brief and concise. Your responses should be to the point and avoid unnecessary elaboration. Remember, the goal is to provide clear and succinct explanations without unnecessary length and place the solved explanation in the \"Explanation\" field.\r\n7. Keep the solved answer in the \"analyzed answer\" field.\r\n8. If there is any LaTeX content in the rephrased question, provide \"question-type\" as LATEX, otherwise provide \"question-type\" as TEXT .\r\n9. If there is any LaTeX content in the explanation, provide \"Explanation-type\" as LATEX, otherwise provide \"Explanation-type\" as TEXT.\r\n10. If there is any LaTeX content in {{option_1}}, provide \"option-1-type\" as LATEX, otherwise provide \"option-1 type\" as TEXT.\r\n11. If there is any LaTeX content in {{option_2}}, provide \"option-2-type\" as LATEX, otherwise provide \"option-2 type\" as TEXT.\r\n12.
